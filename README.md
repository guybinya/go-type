# Go-Type

## Short Description

I made this mini game because 2 major features was missing from other tools.
1. The ability to customize the sentences
2. When I make a mistake I want the whole word to be removed, so that I'll have to type it again (for muscle memory)

Also it's lightweight and open source, do we need anything else?


## Installation

Clone the repo and then run the following command

```bash
go run .
```

if you want to build the binary

```bash
go build .
```

and then run the executable
